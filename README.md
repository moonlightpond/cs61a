# UCB CS61A (Fall 2024): Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
Hi, I'm a math student trying to self-study cs61a. \
\
Homepage: https://cs61a.org/ \
Textbook: https://www.composingprograms.com/      

| Readings | Topics |
| :------: | :----: |
| 1.6 | higher order function, currying, lambda expressions | 
| 1.7 | recursive functions, tree recursion | 
| 2.1 | native data types | 
| 2.2 | data abstraction, abstraciton barriers | 
| 2.3 | sequence, list, sequence unpacking, list comprehension, tree, linked list | 
| 2.4 | immutable/mutable object, tuple, dictionary | 
| 2.5 | class, inheritance |
| 4.2 | iterator, iterable, yield |

Projects:
- [x] hog
- [x] cats
- [x] ants
- [ ] scheme

I skip discussions and I feel lazy to finish the scheme/interpreter part lol.    \
This is a pretty good begining class for me to review the fundamental cs knowledge.    \
I like that all the lab hw project have provided command lines to check the result.
